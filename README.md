# ioBroker.open-wa

## Blockly SendTo block
This adapter provides a Blockly block in the **Sendto** category (like whatsapp-cmb/pushover).

After installing/updating:
- `iobroker upload open-wa`
- restart `javascript.0`
- reload Blockly (Ctrl+F5)

The block uses:
`sendTo("open-wa.X", "send", { to: "...", content: "..." })`
