# ioBroker.open-wa

Adapter to send WhatsApp messages via an open-wa gateway.

## Custom Blockly block (safe)
This adapter ships `admin/blockly.js`.
After installing/updating: restart **javascript.0** once so Blockly reloads custom blocks.

If Blockly ever becomes empty: rename `admin/blockly.js` to disable the custom block and reload Blockly.
